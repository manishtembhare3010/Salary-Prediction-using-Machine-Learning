This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning model that predicts salary based on years of experience.

Key Features:

Predicts salary using a variety of regression algorithms including:
Linear Regression: A simple and fast model effective for linear relationships.
Decision Tree Regression: Handles non-linear relationships and complex data.
Random Forest Regression: Ensembles decision trees for improved accuracy and generalization.
Includes data cleaning and pre-processing steps to ensure model effectiveness.
Provides evaluation metrics to assess model performance, such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
Easy to follow and run on different datasets.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
Pandas library
Scikit-learn library
Matplotlib library (optional, for visualization)
Getting Started:

Clone this repository.
Install the required libraries (if not already installed).
Run the main.py script.
Provide the path to your dataset containing "Years of Experience" and "Salary" columns.
Observe the printed model performance metrics and generated visualizations (if enabled).
Dataset:

The model is designed to work with any dataset containing numerical values for "Years of Experience" and "Salary". You can use your own dataset or public datasets like Kaggle's "Salary_data.csv".

Customization:

You can modify the main.py script to choose the desired regression algorithm and adjust hyperparameters.
Add additional features to the dataset (e.g., education level, skills) for potentially improved prediction accuracy.
Visualize the predicted vs. actual salaries to analyze model behavior.
Disclaimer:

Please note that salary prediction models are for informational purposes only and should not be solely relied upon for career decisions. Factors like location, company, industry, and individual skills also play a significant role in determining salary.
